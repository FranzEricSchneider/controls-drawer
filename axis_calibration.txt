See all the settings with $$

X AXIS
85 millimeters commanded
200 step / mm set
297 millimeters traveled

(85 mm commanded) * (200 steps / mm) = 17000 steps
(17000 steps) / (297 mm) = 57.24 steps / mm


Y AXIS (should be identical b/c of identical hardware)
75 mm commanded
250 step / mm set
303.21 mm traveled

(75 mm commanded) * (250 steps / mm) = 18750 steps
(18750 steps) / (303.21 mm) = 61.84 steps / mm


I'll split the difference and say that both axes have 59.5 steps / mm
If it's an issue later we can re-measure with better tools


I'm setting the max travel to be 400mm, which is above the distance the thing can actually travel, so be safe


I'm setting acceleration to 30 mm/s^2. I'm setting max velocity to 1800 mm/min. Both of these are arbitrary


These values all persist over restarts


For the "Current" values I turned the current all the way down and then turned it 90 degrees clockwise so the slit was at / this angle
