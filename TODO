TODO:

So. If you run the sine/proportional controller you can get nice graphs with
amplitude/phase offsets calculatable. I think this is a good time to step back
and review what the controls system actually is. Is it a one pole system? I
think so, because it is a velocity control problem. Calculate what the system
is and then calculate the constants. What role does Y_V_LIMIT_MPS play? Also,
what happens if the x velocity is slowed down?

After that, start playing with some basic controls things other than proportional
